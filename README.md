# CSCA-5622
## Final Project

This repo contains the code for my final project for CSCA5622 - Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning.

This project aims to predict the prices of second hand cars in the market, using supervised learning ML Models, to help potential customers be better prepared in their search for a second hand car, by having a better understanding/estimation of the price. Here are the steps we will follow to achieve this:

Get the data
Clean the data
Perform EDA
Train Model(s)
Evaluate the model(s) using various metrics (R2, MSE, MAE, RMSE).
